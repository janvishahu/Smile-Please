# Smile-Please
 simple and interactive web project where an emoji changes to a random one on mouse hover. The emoji also scales up and shifts from grayscale to full color for a fun visual effect. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a great beginner project to learn event handling and dynamic UI updates.
